## 🏗 Architecture Overview

### Component Hierarchy
```
App
├── MenuScreen
│   ├── Difficulty Selection
│   └── Action Buttons
└── GameScreen
    ├── Header (Timer, Difficulty, Controls)
    ├── SudokuBoard (9x9 Grid)
    ├── NumberPad (Input Controls)
    └── AdManager (Banner Ads)
```

### Data Flow
1. **Game Initialization**: App → GameManager → SudokuEngine
2. **User Input**: NumberPad → GameScreen → GameManager
3. **Game State**: GameManager → Components (via callbacks)
4. **Persistence**: GameManager → Storage → AsyncStorage
5. **Ads**: AdManager → Google AdMob SDK

## 📝 Code Guidelines

### TypeScript Standards
- Use strict typing throughout
- Define interfaces for all props and data structures
- Avoid `any` type usage
- Use proper error handling

### React Native Best Practices
- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement proper cleanup in useEffect
- Handle platform differences where needed
- Optimize performance with useMemo/useCallback when needed

### Performance Optimization
- Minimize re-renders with proper dependency arrays
- Use efficient algorithms for Sudoku generation
- Implement proper memory cleanup
- Avoid blocking the UI thread

## 🐛 Common Development Issues

### AdMob Issues
**Problem**: Ads not loading in development
**Solution**: Ensure development build is used, not Expo Go

**Problem**: App crashes with AdMob errors
**Solution**: Check app.json configuration and network connectivity

### Performance Issues
**Problem**: Slow puzzle generation
**Solution**: Consider pre-generating puzzles or optimizing algorithms

**Problem**: UI lag during gameplay
**Solution**: Profile with React Native Performance and optimize renders

### Build Issues
**Problem**: Expo prebuild fails
**Solution**: Clear caches with `npx expo prebuild --clean`

**Problem**: Native build errors
**Solution**: Check native dependencies and Android/iOS setup

## 🚀 Deployment Preparation

### Pre-Production Checklist
- [ ] Replace test AdMob IDs with production IDs
- [ ] Update app name and branding in app.json
- [ ] Configure proper bundle identifiers
- [ ] Test on multiple devices and screen sizes
- [ ] Verify ad functionality with real ads
- [ ] Test offline capabilities
- [ ] Performance optimization complete

### Production Build
```bash
# Android
npx expo build:android --type=apk
# Or for Play Store
npx expo build:android --type=app-bundle

# iOS
npx expo build:ios --type=archive
```

### Store Submission Requirements
- App icon (1024x1024)
- Screenshots for all supported devices
- App description and metadata
- Privacy policy (required for AdMob)
- Age rating appropriate for puzzle games
- GDPR compliance documentation

## 📊 Analytics & Monitoring

### Metrics to Track
- **User Engagement**: Session duration, games per session
- **Game Performance**: Completion rates by difficulty
- **Monetization**: Ad impressions, click-through rates
- **Technical**: Crash rates, load times
- **User Acquisition**: Install sources, retention rates

### Recommended Tools
- **Crashlytics**: Crash reporting
- **Firebase Analytics**: User behavior tracking
- **AdMob Reports**: Revenue and performance analytics
- **React Native Performance**: Performance monitoring

## 🔧 Development Tools

### Required Tools
- **Node.js**: v14+ for React Native compatibility
- **Expo CLI**: Latest version for development
- **Android Studio**: For Android development and emulation
- **Xcode**: For iOS development (macOS only)

### Recommended Extensions (VS Code)
- React Native Tools
- TypeScript Hero
- ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native snippets
- Prettier - Code formatter
- ESLint

### Debugging Tools
- **React Native Debugger**: Enhanced debugging
- **Flipper**: Mobile debugging platform
- **Metro Bundler**: JavaScript bundler with hot reload

## 📈 Scaling Considerations

### Technical Scaling
- **Cloud Backend**: Consider Firebase for cloud save
- **CDN**: For puzzle data distribution
- **API Gateway**: For future multiplayer features
- **Microservices**: Separate puzzle generation service

### Business Scaling
- **A/B Testing**: Optimize ad placement and frequency
- **Localization**: Multi-language support
- **Premium Features**: In-app purchases for ad removal
- **Social Features**: Leaderboards and sharing

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive user data
- Implement proper session management
- Follow GDPR guidelines for EU users
- Secure API communications (if added)

### Ad Security
- Use legitimate ad networks only
- Implement ad fraud detection
- Monitor for inappropriate ad content
- Comply with COPPA for child users
