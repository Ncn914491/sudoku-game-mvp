## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Expo CLI
- Android Studio (for Android development)
- Xcode (for iOS development, macOS only)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd SudokuGameMVP
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Run on device/emulator**
   - Press `a` for Android
   - Press `i` for iOS (macOS only)
   - Scan QR code with Expo Go app

### Development Build Setup

For AdMob integration, you'll need to create a development build:

1. **Install Expo Dev Client**
   ```bash
   npx expo install expo-dev-client
   ```

2. **Build development version**
   ```bash
   npx expo run:android  # For Android
   npx expo run:ios      # For iOS (macOS only)
   ```

## 🎮 Game Flow

1. **Main Menu**: Select difficulty level (Easy/Medium/Hard)
2. **Game Generation**: Algorithm creates a valid puzzle with unique solution
3. **Gameplay**: Player fills grid with numbers 1-9
4. **Validation**: Real-time checking with conflict highlighting
5. **Completion**: Game completion detection with statistics update
6. **Monetization**: Interstitial ads shown based on frequency rules

## 💰 AdMob Integration

### Test Ad Units (Development)
- Banner: Test ad unit provided by Google
- Interstitial: Test ad unit provided by Google

### Production Ad Units
Replace test IDs in `src/components/AdManager.tsx` with your actual AdMob ad unit IDs:

```typescript
const BANNER_AD_UNIT_ID = Platform.select({
  ios: 'your-ios-banner-ad-unit-id',
  android: 'your-android-banner-ad-unit-id',
});

const INTERSTITIAL_AD_UNIT_ID = Platform.select({
  ios: 'your-ios-interstitial-ad-unit-id', 
  android: 'your-android-interstitial-ad-unit-id',
});
```

### Ad Frequency Control
- Interstitial ads shown maximum once every 3 minutes
- Minimum 3 games between interstitial ads
- User-friendly ad placement (not intrusive during gameplay)

## 🔧 Configuration

### App Configuration (`app.json`)
- AdMob App IDs configured for both platforms
- Proper bundle identifiers for production deployment
- Optimized initialization settings

### Production Deployment
1. Update AdMob app and ad unit IDs
2. Configure proper bundle identifiers
3. Update app name and branding
4. Build production APK/IPA

## 📊 Performance Considerations

- **Memory Optimization**: Efficient grid management and cleanup
- **Algorithm Efficiency**: Optimized Sudoku generation and solving
- **UI Performance**: Smooth animations and responsive touch handling
- **Ad Loading**: Non-blocking ad initialization and error handling

## 🚨 Known Limitations

- Statistics and Settings screens are placeholders (TODO)
- Save/Resume game functionality partially implemented
- Basic GDPR compliance (may need enhancement for EU deployment)
- Single language support (English only)

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### MVP+ Features
- **Daily Challenges**: Special puzzles with rewards
- **Multiple Themes**: Dark mode and color customization
- **Advanced Statistics**: Detailed analytics and progress tracking
- **Social Features**: Share scores and compete with friends
- **In-App Purchases**: Remove ads, premium features
- **Offline Mode**: Complete functionality without internet

### Technical Improvements
- **Cloud Save**: Sync progress across devices
- **Push Notifications**: Daily challenge reminders
- **Advanced Analytics**: User behavior tracking
- **A/B Testing**: Optimize ad placement and frequency
- **Performance Monitoring**: Crash reporting and analytics

## 📈 Monetization Strategy

1. **Primary**: Banner and interstitial ads via AdMob
2. **Secondary**: Premium version with ad removal
3. **Future**: In-app purchases for hints and themes
4. **Scaling**: Rewarded video ads for extra hints

## 🐛 Debugging

### Common Issues
- **AdMob not loading**: Check internet connection and ad unit IDs
- **App crashes on launch**: Verify all dependencies are installed
- **Performance issues**: Enable Flipper for React Native debugging

### Development Tools
- **Metro Bundler**: JavaScript bundling and hot reload
- **React Native Debugger**: Enhanced debugging experience
- **Flipper**: Mobile app debugging platform
- **Expo Dev Tools**: Integrated development environment
